AI power can be understood as the capacity of electrical power to be converted into digital data processing power, enabling artificial intelligence systems to perform complex tasks. At its core, electrical power provides the energy needed to drive the hardware, such as processors, memory units, and storage devices, that constitute an AI system. The electrical energy flows through circuits and components, powering the computational processes that drive AI algorithms. These algorithms rely on vast amounts of data and require significant computational resources, particularly in fields like machine learning, where massive data sets need to be analyzed and interpreted. As electrical power flows through these systems, it is converted into the ability to process and analyze this information, allowing the AI to make decisions, learn from data, and optimize tasks.

This process of converting electrical power into data processing power is crucial in modern AI applications. The efficiency and scalability of AI systems depend heavily on the underlying hardware's ability to effectively convert electrical energy into computational power. With advances in semiconductor technology, the power of AI has grown exponentially, as more powerful processors and specialized hardware, such as GPUs and TPUs, allow AI systems to process information at unprecedented speeds. This conversion of electrical power into AI-specific computational resources has opened new frontiers in fields like autonomous driving, natural language processing, robotics, and healthcare. By optimizing this conversion process, AI systems continue to evolve, enabling the development of smarter, faster, and more energy-efficient solutions across various industries.

![Contrast](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/16dc41ec-3186-4846-a177-02cf4bcb4438)

There is a contrast between AI-generated media and human-created media. This contrast originated in the 1950s-1960s where researchers began to discuss and develop projects related to simulating human intelligence in machines. Several primitive AI programs were developed at this time. These initial AI programs contrasted human intelligence at it's highest point.

The current contrast between AI-generated media and human-created media in 2024 is still very high. The future of this contrast will be much lower and it will be harder to distinguish the difference between AI-generated media and human-created media. This contrast can be measured and visually plotted on a similar graph like the one below. The contrast follows the growth of AI with a steep slope originating at the 1950s and down to the 2020s.

![AI Growth Over Time](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dff5770f-e584-49fb-9d0d-b6d1a418ed92)

The rapid buildup of custom GPTs in recent years represents a remarkable leap in artificial intelligence development. As depicted in the graph, the growth of AI technology, especially custom GPTs, has seen an exponential rise since the early 2000s. This surge is largely attributed to advancements in computational power, the availability of large datasets, and innovations in deep learning techniques. Custom GPTs have become increasingly popular as they allow businesses, researchers, and even individuals to tailor AI models to specific needs, leading to a more personalized and efficient use of technology. This customization has empowered sectors ranging from healthcare to finance to adopt AI solutions that cater directly to their unique challenges, driving innovation and productivity.

As the adoption of custom GPTs accelerates, the ecosystem surrounding these models is evolving rapidly. Companies are investing heavily in developing more user-friendly tools for creating and managing custom GPTs, making it easier for non-experts to leverage AI. Additionally, the community-driven development of these models has fostered a rich environment for collaboration and knowledge sharing, further fueling their growth. The exponential increase in the use of custom GPTs is also pushing the boundaries of AI's capabilities, leading to breakthroughs in natural language understanding, predictive analytics, and automated decision-making. This rapid growth phase is characterized by a democratization of AI, where access to advanced technologies is no longer restricted to a few but is available to a broader audience.

Looking forward, the future of custom GPTs as the initial revolution settles will likely be marked by greater sophistication and integration into everyday life. As the market matures, we can expect a shift from the current hype-driven expansion to a more stabilized, value-driven adoption. Custom GPTs will become more seamlessly embedded into various platforms and services, making AI an invisible yet integral part of our digital experience. This period will also see increased focus on the ethical use of AI, ensuring that the deployment of custom GPTs is aligned with societal values and regulations. In the long term, custom GPTs could evolve to become highly specialized assistants or partners, capable of understanding and anticipating user needs with minimal input, thereby redefining how we interact with technology.
