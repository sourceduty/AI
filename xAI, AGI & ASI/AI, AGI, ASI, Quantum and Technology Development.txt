The visualization above represents the projected technological progress from 2024 to 2050 under four different scenarios: baseline technology growth, with the introduction of general artificial intelligence (AI), and with the further advancements brought by Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and Artificial Superintelligence (ASI), as well as the impact of quantum computing. The baseline represents a steady, yet modest growth rate which is typical of technological progress without major disruptive innovations. The introduction of general AI shows a slightly enhanced growth trajectory, indicating the broad improvements AI could bring to various fields through enhanced automation and optimization capabilities, which are less dramatic but more widespread than those brought by AGI and ASI.

The scenarios with AGI/ASI and quantum computing depict significantly accelerated growth curves, highlighting their potential to cause exponential leaps in technology development. AGI and ASI could revolutionize problem-solving and innovation speeds across all sectors by achieving and surpassing human intellectual capabilities, thereby unlocking new possibilities in science, engineering, and other domains. Similarly, quantum computing could dramatically enhance computational powers, making previously intractable problems solvable and further accelerating the pace of scientific discovery. The visualization starkly illustrates how these advanced technologies could diverge from current trends and drive a future where technological capabilities expand at an unprecedented rate, profoundly reshaping society and its technological landscape.
