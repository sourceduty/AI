When Will AI and ASI Think for Themselves?

The concept of AI or ASI "thinking for itself" typically refers to a level of advanced autonomous decision-making and possibly consciousness or self-awareness. Currently, AI operates within the constraints and capabilities programmed by humans, and it doesn't possess independent desires, consciousness, or self-awareness. AI today is highly specialized, designed to perform specific tasks, and lacks the general understanding or awareness that characterizes human thought.

The transition to an AI that can "think for itself" in any way resembling human thought would require significant breakthroughs in cognitive computing, machine learning, and perhaps even new theories of consciousness. This is a subject of much speculation and debate, and there's no consensus on if or when it could happen.

Self-Awareness

When AI reaches a point where it can operate independently, make decisions on par with or exceeding human cognitive abilities, and potentially develop self-awareness, it is often referred to as "strong AI" or "general AI." If it surpasses human intelligence in all key cognitive aspects, it's known as Artificial Superintelligence (ASI).

When Will ASI Guide Humans?

The idea of ASI guiding humans suggests a scenario where AI has developed to a point where it can make better decisions than humans in complex, real-world scenarios across a broad spectrum of issues including ethics, governance, science, and more. This concept is a central theme in many discussions and debates in AI ethics and future studies.

Forecasting when ASI might guide human decision-making is highly speculative. Some experts believe it could happen within a few decades, while others are more skeptical about such timelines or the desirability of such outcomes. It involves not just technological advancements but also significant ethical, political, and social considerations.

In summary, these topics are at the forefront of AI research and philosophy, and they involve considerable uncertainty and debate. Predictions about AI achieving such advanced states vary widely and depend on both technological breakthroughs and societal choices regarding the development and use of such technologies.
